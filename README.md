# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed an application to YearOne. The Stack: React + Node/Express + Postgres. It took about 3 days and just finished.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with some of the logic for the backend. But it was an awesome experience building a new Node Explress and Sequelize api which I have never done before. It feels great to learn a new stack in 1.5 days! Feeling accomplished for the week.
