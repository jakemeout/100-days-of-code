# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Goal

Spend at least 1 hour a day, coding and sharing updating the status here. 
### Day 0: December 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed an application to YearOne. The Stack: React + Node/Express + Postgres. It took about 3 days and just finished.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with some of the logic for the backend. But it was an awesome experience building a new Node Explress and Sequelize api which I have never done before. It feels great to learn a new stack in 1.5 days! Feeling accomplished for the week.

### Day 1: December 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I went to a few workshops and didn't get a chance to code much, but I did dicuss with my team about a project for the hackathon the next day. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with coding this day, as I attended [Hackcamp](https://hackcamp.nwplus.io/).

### Day 2: December 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a fullstack app for hack camp. React front end with flask/postgres backend.

**Thoughts:** Mainly worked on the front end react app. We had to do a lot of discussion and explanation of how to make the app work, so lost some time for the hackathon. However, it was great to revisit a basic page layout and build it quickly. I still learned alot

# Starting over...

### Day 0: December 13th 2020

**Today's Progress** I have completed two leetcode problems [MoveZeros](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/567/) and [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/546/). I started reviewing a video and a tutorial on Validation of Sudoku as well. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with Sudoku quite a bit, but after learning the value of a HashSet it makes much more sense!

 ### Day 1: December 14th 2020

**Today's Progress** I created a line that will follow my cursor and draw it self as it follows. Looking to make this more of a bunch of lines that attack the cursor wherever it goes. 

**Thoughts:** I need to read a heck of a lot more on canvas, it is dense. Also I need to learn more about linear algebra.
